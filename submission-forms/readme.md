# Submission forms

### Submission forms are defined as datapages with submission as its sole function (as opposed to e.g. single record update forms or details report pages).

### In each of the sub-folders is a collection of dependencies for each of the datapages using submission forms. The snippets containing the CDN path to each of the dependencies are listed in the readme.md file of each folder with instructions on where to insert each snippet in the datapage.
